Email validation is an essential aspect of web development when it comes to ensuring the accuracy and integrity of user-submitted data. In JavaScript, there are several techniques and methods you can employ to validate email addresses effectively. In this blog post, we will explore different approaches to validate email addresses using JavaScript, providing you with a comprehensive guide to implement this crucial functionality in your web applications.


## Regular Expressions Method:

```javascript
function validateEmail(email) {
  // Regular expression pattern for email validation
  const emailPattern = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  
  // Check if the email matches the pattern
  return emailPattern.test(email);
}

// Example usage
const email = "example@email.com";
const isValidEmail = validateEmail(email);
console.log(isValidEmail); // Output: true or false
```

This function takes an email as input and uses a regular expression pattern (emailPattern) to validate it. The pattern ensures that the email contains at least one character before and after the ```"@"``` symbol and includes a ```"."``` symbol followed by at least one character.


To use the function, simply pass an email address as an argument to ```validateEmail```. The function will return true if the email is valid and false otherwise. In the example above, the ```isValidEmail``` variable stores the result of email validation for demonstration purposes. You can replace the ```email``` variable with any email address you want to validate.



## HTML5 Input Type:

```html
 <form>
    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
```


This example demonstrates email validation using HTML5's built-in email input type. The input element has ```type="email"```, which triggers the browser's built-in email validation. The required attribute ensures that the user must provide an email address before submitting the form.

*Note: This validation is performed on the client-side and can be bypassed by users. It is important to also perform server-side validation to ensure the integrity of the submitted data.*

## JavaScript Library/Plugin:


You can also use NPMs. A great example is [email-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-validator)

**Install via NPM:**

```
npm install email-validator
```

**Usage** 

-Javascript:

```javascript
var validator = require("email-validator");
validator.validate("test@email.com"); // true
```

-TypeScript

```typescript
import * as EmailValidator from 'email-validator';
EmailValidator.validate("test@email.com"); // true
```
