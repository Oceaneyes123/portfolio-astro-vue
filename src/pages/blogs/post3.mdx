Let's start with your HTML:

```html
<div class="container">
    <div class="content">Centered Content</div>
</div>
```

When it comes to vertically centering text, there are multiple approaches you can take depending on the context and requirements of your project. Here are four common methods:

**Using CSS Flexbox:**

Flexbox is a CSS layout model that provides a simple way to vertically center elements. You can apply the following CSS to the parent container of the text:

```css
Copy code
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

This will center the text both vertically and horizontally within the container.

**Using CSS Grid:**

CSS Grid is another CSS layout model that allows you to create grid-based layouts. To vertically center text using CSS Grid, you can define a grid container and apply the following CSS to it:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

This will center the text both vertically and horizontally within the container.

**Using CSS Table Display:**

You can also use the table display properties to vertically center text. Apply the following CSS to the parent container of the text:

```css
.container {
  display: table;
  height: 100%; /* Set a fixed height or use a parent with a defined height */
}

.content {
  display: table-cell;
  vertical-align: middle;
  text-align: center; /* For horizontal centering */
}
```

This approach simulates a table structure and vertically centers the content within the table cell.

**Using CSS Positioning:**

If you know the height of the container, you can use absolute positioning to vertically center the text. Apply the following CSS to the text element:

```css
.content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  transform: translateY(-50%);
}
```

This will move the text element 50% down from the top of its containing element and then shift it back up by 50% of its own height, effectively centering it vertically.

Choose the method that suits your project requirements and the browser compatibility you need to support.
